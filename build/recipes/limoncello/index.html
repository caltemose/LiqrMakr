          Limoncello
        </h2>
        <p>
          This recipe is a great starter recipe into the process of making liquors because it's quick and can be extended to include many types of citrus. If you've spent time in Italy (or just know Italians) you'll know there are many recipes for limoncello (like everything else). I originally learned of this recipe from 'Many Beautiful Things', a story/recipe book by the actor Vincent Schiavelli, whose family is from Sicily. It's a great read.

          This recipe will make <input size="5" type="text" value="750" /> ml of limoncello.

          1. Mix
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mix these ingredients and store in an airtight glass container.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <input size="5" type="text" value="300" /> ml grain alcohol
          </li>
          <li>
            peeled skins from <input size="2" type="text" value="3" /> meyer lemons
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          2. Wait
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>4 </strong>days minimum. The peels turn white eventually which tells you there's no reason to macerate any longer.
        </p>
        <h2>
          3. Finish
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Make simple syrup the day before you filter and bottle the alcohol. You'll need:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>250ml</strong> water
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>120ml</strong> sugar
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Heat the water, add the sugar and dissolve and let the syrup cool before adding to macerated alcohol.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Filter the macerated alcohol. In this case just remove the peels - filtering through a coffee filter is mostly a waste of time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the simple syrup to the macerated alcohol. Do this in a container that will make it easy to pour the result using a funnel into your final bottle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bottle the results. The limoncello will mellow out if you let it sit for a few weeks (or longer) but it's ready to enjoy immediately.
          </li>
        </ul>
