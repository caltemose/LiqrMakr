          Limoncello
        </h2>
        <p>
          This recipe is a great starter recipe into the process of making liquors because it's quick and can be extended to include many types of citrus. If you've spent time in Italy (or just know Italians) you'll know there are many recipes for limoncello (like everything else). I originally learned of this recipe from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Many-Beautiful-Things-Vincent-Schiavelli-ebook/dp/B003L77WJ6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389206819&sr=8-1&keywords=many+beautiful+things">'Many Beautiful Things'</a>, a story/recipe book by the actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001704/">Vincent Schiavelli</a>, whose family is from Sicily. It's a great read.

          1. Mix
        </h2>
        <p>
          Mix these ingredients and store in an airtight glass container.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <input id="alcohol" size="5" type="number" value="300" /> ml grain alcohol (at 95%).
          </li>
          <li>
            peeled skins from <input id="flavoring" size="2" type="number" value="3" /> meyer lemons
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          2. Wait
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>4 </strong>days minimum. A few days more is fine.
        </p>
        <h2>
          3. Finish
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Make simple syrup the day before you filter and bottle the alcohol. You'll need:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong><span id="syrupWater">250ml</span></strong> water
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong><span id="syrupSugar">120ml</span></strong> sugar
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Heat the water, add the sugar and dissolve and let the syrup cool before adding to macerated alcohol.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Filter the macerated alcohol. In this case just remove the peels - filtering through a coffee filter is mostly a waste of time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the simple syrup to the macerated alcohol. Do this in a container that will make it easy to pour the result using a funnel into your final bottle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bottle the results. The limoncello will mellow out if you let it sit for a few weeks (or longer) but it's ready to enjoy immediately.
          </li>
        </ul>
